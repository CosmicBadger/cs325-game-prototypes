<h2>Your game title</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
My game uses the same principle as Frogger- dodge things that can kill you, but adds an elements of searching for an end destination. It is my intention for iterations to include a procedurally generated "forest" which will act as a maze, further intensifying the search element.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
My game uses many sprites which can collide with each other and yield a different game result based on the nature of the collision.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I am horribly lost with Tilemaps. I spent hours just trying to get one to render, and I still can only get the json file from the template to work properly. I'm using the template file with modified tile graphics because I can't get my own tilemaps to even appear on the page. The reason that there are no trees/obstacles in this version is that I'm unable to get my tilemap up and running. It's my intention to get help on this for the next iteration.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
All of my assets were made from scratch, but my house asset drew heavy inspiration from the house design in Pokemon Ruby/Sapphire.

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I based this game on Frogger, with the intention of giving it a maze-oriented twist. This iteration still innovates on the Frogger concept, but doesn't yet have the maze implemented.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Find your way to your destination without getting eaten by wolves.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
This game uses the "6 months to live" theme in the story told on the home page.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
The
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
Like I've said above, it was my intention for the "hook" of this game to be to test the mechanics of wolves bouncing about through a maze, but since the maze isn't working, I resolved to make fundamentals work in this version (i.e. wolves being able to detect collision and eat Little Red or Little Red making it successfully to the house).
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
I want players to have a fast-paced, possibly anxiety inducing, experience of dodging wolves while searching for their destination.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
In this game, you control Little Red, who follows your mouse cursor. Your goal is to navigate Little Red to Granny's House. Many wolves move randomly across the field, blocking your route to Granny's House. Little Red must make it to her destination without colliding with a wolf.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
This game is very impulsive and there isn't a whole lot of room for strategy. If there's one thing I've noticed from playing it, it's that taking to much time and "playing it safe" puts you at risk of being boxed in by wolves- you're best off belining for the house.
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
This game takes place in the fantasy setting of Little Red Riding Hood, except now there are many wolves looking to eat Little Red rather than just one. I suppose the word got out in the wolf community that Little Red is dumb enough to walk through their territory unarmed and alone.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This game appeals to people more or less looking to kill time- tt can be played quickly with little conscious thought.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
My game only takes 10-20 seconds in the current iteration. My hope is once the maze element comes into play it will take more like 1-2 minutes.
