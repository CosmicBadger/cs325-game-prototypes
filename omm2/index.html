<h2>Your game title</h2>

<ul>
<li><strong>Originality:</strong>
My game combines Clue-like information gathering and guessing mechanics with the relative simplicity of a quick card game. This version introduces a new, competitive AI opponent which makes intelligent, non-random decisions.
</li>

<li><strong>Technical Merit:</strong>
My game is more demanding in terms of logic compared with my previous projects, which have leaned more on utilizing Phaser's capabilities. The game utilizes a random animal generator, multiple arrays full of unique animals, the ability to compare them with each other, take action on the basis of those comparisons, and features an extensive amount of logic surrounding the behavior of the AI and the way it interacts with the board and the player.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
I did this project in large part to develop my comfortability with JavaScript as opposed to just Phaser. This was my first time coding a meaningful amount of logic (while-loops, for-loops, arrays, etc.) in JavaScript and it, naturally, involved of reading, trial-and-error, and patience. This iteration stretched the logic even further, challenging me to code an AI which would make decisions intelligently based on the information it gathered and information gleened from the player's actions.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
All assets drawn by me.
<ul>
<li></a></li>
</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I like of my game as a bit like Clue, but simplified and taking only a quarter of the time. The only borrowed code was a single line regarding generating random numbers within a designated range and it is cited within the code.
</li>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Strategically gather information and make guesses before your opponent can.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
I've still not gotten around to reworking the game's aesthetics, but it does (subtely) use the "soap opera" theme, which inspired the title and the cheesy story.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
This game only uses randomness to generate animals over varying types and the actual playstyle is more strategy-based than luck-based on net. Genre-wise, I suppose I would classify it loosely as "turn-based strategy".
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The last version tested  mechanics regarding testing objects against each other, generating random cards which won't be duplicates, grabbing from and interacting with multiple arrays, and getting buttons to interact with each other. This version tests the capacity of the AI to make decisions which are strong enough to be competitive, not too strong so as to be no-fun, and just generally functional, i.e. not bugging out by taking multiple turns, guessing already guessed conspirators, etc..
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
Rather than utilize all of Phaser's emphasis on physics, I wanted to create a game more reminiscent of an analog experience.that will make people stop and think, in a chess-like way, rather than present another arcadey experience.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
In this game, the goal is (see: will be) to guess 3 out of 5 "conspirators" before your opponent can. Each conspirator can be one of four colors and one of four species, which you must guess correctly to reveal them. Given 16 different possible combinations, you'll need to gather information about them before guessing. This is done by using "witnesses", which also have a color and species and are compared against a chosen conspirator. The system then reveals whether the witness matched color, species, both, or neither. Both players have access to a public pool of 6 witnesses and a private pool of 2 witnesses. Using a public witness has the disadvantage of sharing information with your opponent, while private witnesses allow you to gather information discreetly. It's worth saying that the current prototype doesn't have an opponent, so as of right now, the goal is simply to guess all of the conspirators.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
After playtesting, I was relieved to find that the game isn't procedural and there is considerable room for strategy surrounding (a) investigating the conspirators out of order and (b) using a healthy mix of public and private witnesses. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story/Setting/Premise:</strong>
The story and setting is supposed to be comical, combining soap-opera melodrama with an ironically happy farm setting full of unusually-pigmented animals. The story involves intrigue surrounding the disappearance of a popular goose on the farm and the player's mission to identify the conspirators.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
My target audience is the "bored college kid" or anyone with a bit of time to kill.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Roughly 3-5 minutes per game.
</li>
